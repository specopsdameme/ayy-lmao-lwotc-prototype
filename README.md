#Ayy Lmao Long War Of the EdgeLords Ediszyn
#What the fuck is this?
This is a continuation of a joke mod found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1125601165&searchtext=ayy+lmao):
I have recieved permission from the author to continue, and expand the "project".
Currently, the main goal is to fully integrate it  with the Long war of the Chosen Mod found [here](https://github.com/long-war-2/lwotc).
Note: THE MAIN DEVS HAVE NOTHING TO WITH THIS. I TAKE ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ABOMINATION.
#Current state
Not even close to ready. Some enemies are missing, tons of unupdated text, however the bare minimum is there.
#Job list
*Figure out the names for the rest of the enemmies. The ones left are:
        *Drones
        *MEC Archer
        *ADVENT Gunner
        *ADVENT scout
        *ADVENT commmando
        *ADVENT Sergeant
        *ADVENT Engineer
*Catch the remaining UI text ("untranslated" enemies, aliens instead of Ayyliens, supplies instead of Dosh)
* Finish the status effect "translations"
*"Translate" more skills. I already figured out how to make abilities throw out LocFlyoverText instead of LocalFriendlyName, so the only thing remaining is doing exactly that.
*If I'm feeling ambitious, "translate" some of the spoken subtitles.
