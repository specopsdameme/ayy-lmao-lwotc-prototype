Additionally, the cadaver of this subject also appears to have several cybernetic endoskeletons to boost the already powerful genetic modifications of this subject, some of which might might be useful for our weapon developments.

Summary="Aside from the variety of fascinating genetic enhancements found in the ADVENT Mall Ninjas, the /k/ommandos appear to be augmented further with some kind of biomechanical implant. I believe this allows for some form of communication throughout the ayylien hierarchy. If we were to somehow tap into this system, I wonder, what memes might we hear?"
LongDescription="Physically larger and more tactically capable than the subordinate Mall Ninjas, the ADVENT /k/ommandos administer a system of control over the Mall Ninjas through a carefully engineered Psionic link augmented with a mechanical implant. From my initial examination of the Commander and a careful review of the information gathered in the Ayylien containment area, I now have a theory as to how this system was established.\n\n It is my firm belief that this process of Psionic control was specifically engineered to allow rapid deployment of tactical memes drawn directly from the subconscious mind - in this case, the mind of our very own Commander. With this hierarchy in place, tactical memetics stored in the depths of the Commander's mind was processed and transmitted to the ADVENT /k/ommando's, who in turn directed the Mall Ninjas and other subordinates. With the Commander no longer attached to their Psionic network, it's difficult to say how the orders are being dispersed at this point - although I'm sure the ayyliens have planned for this potential contingency.\n\n I believe it may be possible to tap into this \"Network,\" but it would require the use of a living ADVENT /k/ommando to function as our conduit. To facilitate this difficult task, we've worked to develop a new device, the \"Skullfucker,\" which should be capable of disabling a /k/ommando. From there, it's simply a matter of hacking the /k/ommando in the field - although I won't speculate as to the outcome. R. Tygan."

DisplayName="Ayylien Encryption"
Summary="Unlike the conventional encryption methods we would typically encounter with terrestrial data stores, the ayyliens appear to be using an advanced matrix consisting of both mechanical and biological cyphers, combined with some form of Psionic interference. The thought of uncovering the ayyliens' most complex memes is both intriguing and frightening in equal measure."
LongDescription="Before we can even begin to attempt decrypting the ayylien meme stores, we must first come to understand the means by which they protect their most valuable memes. It was immediately clear that the ayyliens do not rely solely on conventional algorithms, but instead use a complex matrix of interwoven biological signatures as part of the cypher itself. An additional layer of protection is afforded by an ongoing field of Psionic interference, tied directly into the ADVENT network itself. If we're to have any chance of defeating the multiple safeguards the ayyliens have in place, it's likely we'll have to design specialized equipment to isolate each layer of encryption before we attempt to press on with our investigation.

LongDescription="The Computer Waifu itself is a remarkable entity, far beyond our expectations of what a sentient, biological organism could or should be. Our limited exposure to it leaves a number of open questions, and as it appears to phase or flux out of our visible spectrum, it will undoubtedly prove to be a difficult specimen to study. In any case, our troops were able to recover what can only be described as the Computer Waifu \"Brain,\" a central processing unit encompassing data storage, communications, tactical control, as well as a host of other functions we've yet to identify.\n\nWith the Shadow Chamber in place, Shen and I conducted a thorough, albeit difficult series of experiments to unravel the mysteries of the device. Through a series of high-frequency exposures, we were successful in forcing the Computer Waifu to reveal itself, beyond the confines of the Brain alone. Shen expressed varying concerns about the well-being of the Computer Waifu, as it appeared to be responding, and even resisting, our efforts to decrypt the data and access the ADVENT network. I assured her any indication of pain or active intolerance of our testing was merely a byproduct of the procedure. Before the Computer Waifu destroyed itself, along with our containment area, we did manage to recover a subset of the data containing what appears to be a set of map coordinates. It will take more time to work through the remaining fragments, but in the interim we have a lead to pursue. R. Tygan."

Summary="Our initial efforts to delve into the Computer Waifu Brain data provided us with a sequence of map coordinates. However, we still have fragments of data that the Computer Waifu attempted to destroy, which would imply a value to this data far beyond what we've discovered so far."
LongDescription="With time set aside to further analyze the data fragments leftover from our initial Computer Waifu experiment, I've finally managed to crack their code - and the resulting data is perhaps more valuable, and shocking, than I had expected. I understand now why the Computer Waifu was willing to sacrifice itself to protect this information.\n\nIn the shadows, the ayylien overseers, known to us as the \"Elders,\" have continued to work in secret since the very beginnings of ADVENT. Although Central Officer Bradford tells me that no one has seen an Elder in the flesh for over a decade, we continue to see monuments in their likeness throughout the city centers. This is because they never left: they simply fell into the shadows, focusing their efforts on a more dire concern - the Elders are dying.\n\nAmong the diverse and widely varied ayylien specimens we've encountered, the Elders are uniquely afflicted by some form of Space AIDS. Their physical forms are no longer capable of containing the Psionic energy that is the Elders' lifeblood. Just as we've encountered these unique ayylien species in the field, at some point in the past, the Elders encountered them as well - and used them in an attempt to cure this plague among their own kind. Unfortunately for them, and for us, it seems they've never found this cure, and now it appears they are looking to use humanity as their next candidate. R. Tygan."

CodeName="Heiroglyph"
LongDescription="Although the logistical concerns involved in transporting a large piece of potentially unstable ayylien technology were difficult to manage, they are easily dwarfed by the risks involved in attempting to operate this device within the confines of the Avenger. Although Shen and I both had our concerns, given the directives of our operation, we saw little alternative but to begin experimenting on this Gateway as soon as possible.\n\nAfter a period of slow, deliberate power increases accompanied by the appropriate level of monitoring, we felt comfortable enough to leave the Gateway operating in its idle state. At that point, we conducted a series of simple tests on various objects to better understand how the ayyliens use the device for transportation. Initially, we saw no means of actually putting the Gateway into an active state. That is to say, the Gateway itself seemed to disregard or ignore the objects we passed through.\n\nHaving studied the ayylien Computer Waifu and its ability to open rifts in the field for deployment, we theorized the Gateway may be tied to a similar signal or key integrated into the Computer Waifu itself. Sure enough, by mirroring the frequencies found in close proximity to the Computer Waifu, we found that the Gateway itself enters a second, active condition.\n\nShen was hesitant to relegate her pet GREMLIN to use in our experiment, but she recognized the value in having a remote test subject, and we had no other units available to spare. Unfortunately, our initial theories as to the Gateway's function overlooked the possibility that it was also tied to the biological components of the Computer Waifu. Shen's personal GREMLIN suffered some relatively minor damage during our test, but its sacrifice led to an important revelation in terms of how we might access this Gateway and discover its source.

CodeName="Primarch"
LongDescription="We have dedicated the entirety of our efforts to discovering the purpose of the Advent Calendar, and now, it seems we're finally gaining ground on the ayyliens. With that said, I was shocked to see that our troops not only encountered what was apparently a fully responsive Super Saiyan specimen, but that it engaged them in combat and was subsequently dispatched with only moderate difficulty.\n\nWith all that went in to its creation, somehow I expected that the Super Saiyan wouldn't be such a bitch. Initially, it appeared as though my assumptions were wrong.\n\nHumanoid in form, the physical attributes of the Super Saiyan specimen are, on the surface, wholly unremarkable. It has a musculature system not all that unlike a young adult human, with no obvious genetic adulterations to enhance its physical strength or agility. At this point I could only surmise that the ayyliens focused entirely on what lies beneath the Avatar's seemingly ordinary structure.\n\nAs I continued my analysis of the Avatar specimen, including a rapid genetic sequencing aided by the Shadow Chamber, I discovered my earlier conclusions could not be further from the truth. This Avatar, what was left of it, is still not \"whole\" in a developmental sense. Although portions of the missing genetic links have since been filled with what is undoubtedly Elder DNA, there are still gaps; incomplete sequences that leave the creature unable to fully sustain its own power. It is now my firm belief that we have yet to encounter a fully developed Super Saiyan, and its potential capabilities at full strength leave me deeply concerned. R. Tygan."

LongDescription="With little time to prepare, we were forced to conduct an extremely invasive procedure on the Commander in order remove what appeared to be an implant carefully enmeshed within the occipital lobe. Although all indications were that the device was not designed for removal, concerns as to the Commander's potential longevity, and the risk of possible remote manipulation by the ayyliens, left us with little alternative.\n\nDespite my concerns, the Commander has so far felt no lasting effects from the procedure and appears to be recovering ahead of expectations. As for the chip itself, my initial findings are alarming, to say the least. The device is Psionically-driven by the latent energy of the subject's brain, in this case, the Commander. More importantly, it appears the device functions as both a transmitter and receiver, relaying information via some form of Psionic link.\n\nEven after removal, I've had to shield the device to contain the residual Psionic fields surrounding the implant itself, for fear of what it might be capable of. If my current theory is correct, the Commander may have played a more important role in ADVENT's operations than we could have possibly imagined. R. Tygan."

CodeName="Keksburg"
LongDescription="Preliminary autopsy exam conducted by Dr. Richard Tygan, acting science officer. Although my direct surgical experience is limited, the ayyliens' genetic manipulation of the species previously catalogued as a Pectoid provides a certain familiarity in relation to human anatomy. While the earliest documented accounts of Pectoids on earth indicated examples no larger than one meter in height, the specimens we encounter today are all nearly twice that size. Knowing full well that the ayyliens continue their efforts to integrate human and ayylien DNA, my findings here only reinforce the notion of a continuous development process. This larger Pectoid variant has an even greater proportion of human genetic material, selectively combined with the intention of improving the otherwise limited physical capabilities of the original. With enhanced Psionic capabilities and greater overall strength, I'd say they've succeeded. R. Tygan."

Still, the underlying physiology is remarkably similar to a number of terrestrial species - including the venom sacs, which we might be able to synthesize and incorporate for use in our medical supplies."
CodeName="Strangle"
LongDescription="I find it truly remarkable how adaptable some of the ayylien species' genetics are to the constant \"tweaks\" they're often subjected to. In the case of the \"Snek,\" a species once identified as the infiltration unit known as a \"Thin Mint,\" the ayyliens have made a conscious reduction in their efforts to disguise its true form. Without the introduction of extensive human genetic material, the Snek reverts to a purely reptilian form while apparently retaining the same intellect and combat aptitude. The Snek's snake-like form is in many ways similar to the legless reptiles we commonly encounter on Earth. The enhanced torso musculature allows for upright mobility, and the addition of two physically weak but capable arms allows for the handling of traditional weaponry. Of the many ayylien species our troops encounter in the field, I find the prospect of encountering an intelligent snake standing over 2 meters tall to be among the most disturbing. R. Tygan."

As they say, the current breed is apparently on the smaller side, although considerably more agile than the originals. Internally, the subject maintains all the hallmarks of extensive genetic modification, with additional musculature and bone protecting the internal organs from any risk of direct contact. The ayyliens clearly spent a great deal of time and effort honing the abilities of the Dickhead as a hard, unyielding monolith in battle. I had heard that our soldiers believe the Dickheads to be part of a tribal society, at least originally, based on their unusual battle cries and markings seen in the field. Having finally gotten a closer look, I can confirm the presence of unusual scarification that could certainly be attributed to ritualistic behavior of some kind. R. Tygan."

Upon initial examination, it's difficult to ignore the extreme muscle growth present throughout the specimen, leaving little need for extensive armor or even conventional weaponry for that matter. I suspect the added bulk of the subject to be the direct result of an intentional protein deficiency engineered by the ayyliens explicitly to create the hulking mass we see today. As for its behavior, I can only infer that was intended as well, as the ayyliens are well within their capability to manipulate the endocrine glands or equivalent for the purposes of hormonal behavioral control. In any case, this is an extremely dangerous and unstable species, best avoided by our troops at anything other than long range. R. Tygan."

Although similar in size and physical structure to the Dickhead species, the \"Big Daddy\" as it's come to be known does not appear to be of the same genetic design as the Dickhead. I stress design here because perhaps more so than all but the most extreme examples, the Big Daddy was engineered to exist only within the confines of the environmental suit we see them wearing in the field.

Where one might expect to find a skeletal foundation, we instead see a series of malleable chitin-like structures providing various points for the expansion of several equally unusual fluid membranes.\n\nThe membranes in question are responsible for the Fellow Human's extraordinary ability to mirror the form of a human. In recirculating key cellular combinations via an elaborate internal structure, the Fellow Human is capable of forming solid shapes while also mirroring colors and textures without physical sampling. As of yet we've only seen evidence of the Fellow Human attempting to imitate humans, but not other species or inanimate objects.

LongDescription="An inherently terrifying and unpleasant species to encounter by surprise, I can only admire our troops for their courage in dealing with the species known as the \"Zergling.\" Mirroring the general form of a common Arthropod, immediately noticeable is the sleek, armored exoskeleton protecting its segmented body. Of particular concern for our troops are the honed points of the Zergling's fangs and legs, capable of inflicting critical injuries on their own, they also allow for the creature's gruesome means of rapid reproduction in the field.\n\nAlthough Central Officer Bradford insists that he witnessed a different, equally invasive means of Zergling gestation during the earliest days of the war, there is no evidence that such attacks still occur today. Unfortunately, from what he's described, I would say the ayyliens have actually evolved the process into a more efficient, and deadly, solution. The Zerglings we see today inject a venom that immediately begins softening the structure of the victim's internal organs, preparing the subject to serve as a both the material for a gestation cocoon, and as a ready supply of nutrients for the Zergling young. Should the victim fail to receive medical support and expire, the cocoon will form shortly thereafter. Assuming the cocoon is not destroyed during the initial gestation period, we can expect up to three Zergling young to emerge after an impressively short period of growth.\n\nRecent reports from the field indicate some form of \"burrowing\" behavior, perhaps another evolution of past techniques, in this case likely for defensive purposes.

Although rumors as to their origins have persisted for years, it's only recently that we've confirmed that they are in fact the product of a human-ayylien hybrid development. My initial autopsy indicates that the Mall Ninjas were at one time entirely human, implying some means of gradual genetic enhancement without the rejection concerns that would normally plague these experiments. The body itself maintains the general outward appearance of a typical human, with the most crucial changes occurring in the cranial structure. It is my belief that the ADVENT Mall Ninjas receive their memes, that is to say are controlled, directly through a Psionic link engineered as part of the genetic modification process. As we first discovered in the field, the eyes are notably larger, perhaps as an unintended side-effect, as they seem to provide only limited improvements to the Mall Ninja's visual acuity.

However, a minor yet crucial adjustment to the muscle fiber density of the Lancer improves both agility and overall survivability. Equipped with non-lethal weapons capable of easily disabling human targets, SANICs were first deployed during the earliest days following ADVENT's establishment of the city centers, when civil unrest was a more common problem than outright resistance. In studying their usage and deployment, this raised an interesting question - if the SANICs were among the first ADVENT forces deployed, and their survivability is somewhat higher than that of the standard Mall Ninja - did the ayyliens consciously reduce the Mall Ninja's strength based on their assessment of human combat readiness? This would imply a system of rapid genetic modification beyond what I had previously imagined the ayyliens were capable of.

LongDescription="Among the ayyliens' more reclusive forces, the ADVENT unit we've come to identify as the \"Pedophile\" has recently become a regular sighting for our forces deployed in the field. These Pedophiles apparently wield a great deal of power over their subordinate ADVENT units, relying on Psionic control to issue orders and exert their will in battle.\n\nWhile their physical appearance is no more striking than that of a typical ADVENT soldier, their talents in wielding Psionic energy clearly differentiates them from the standard hybrid unit. Based on my post-mortem examination, I believe the source of this increased proficiency comes from careful genetic manipulation, a hallmark of the Elders' forces. In this case, an unusual synaptic configuration allows for what I believe to be Psionic transduction between otherwise distinct and unrelated cell types found throughout the body.\n\nIn combat, these increased pathways for the storage and release of Psionic energy allow the Pedophile to project control over its enemies in the field, while bolstering the survivability of its allies. Perhaps most critically, the Pedophile has been known to sustain its own life force through Psionic manipulation, cheating death in a way not seen among the Elders' other subordinate Ayylien races.

With that knowledge in mind, it fell to me to discover the cause of this extreme, grotesque corruption of these unsuspecting victims.\n\nBased on their proximity to the abandoned cities of the invasion and the information gathered from various eyewitness accounts, our most plausible theory as to the origins of the Lost revolves around the so-called \"Fog Pods\" dropped throughout these cities during the earliest days after the Ayyliens' arrival on Earth.

However, when moving or engaging in combat actions, this form is quickly broken to reveal the truly amorphous nature of the Ransomware.\n\nAlthough I had conceived of a number of theories as to how this was taking place, e.g. swarming nanorobots, Ayylien insects, perhaps even some sort of Psionic particle-matrix, it isn't immediately clear that any of those hypotheses are out of the realm of possibility.  As of yet we've found no means of recovering one of these Ransomwares in their \"assembled\" form, leaving little evidence as to their true composition. Although it would seem likely that the Spectre holds some intrinsic connection to the equally elusive Computer Waifu, their means of traversing our world are distinct enough to require a different approach if we hope to further our research. -R.

[ChosenAssassinWeapons X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Edgy Weapons"
Summary="The Edgelord Assassin proved deadly with both her sword and her shotgun, and both will no doubt be valuable to our efforts.  However, I believe the sword, conceivably forged by the Elders own hands, to be the true asset here."
CodeName="Hanzo"
LongDescription="Having recovered both of the Edgelord Assassin's weapons from the field, a shotgun and a modular sword, I must admit I am intrigued by the advances the Ayyliens have managed to craft into these otherwise conventional weapons.\n\nThe shotgun, used primarily as a secondary weapon by the Elders' Assassin, is elegant in its simplicity and adherence to a singular purpose. Built upon an advanced composite frame, in close quarters the unique design is nearly unmatched by any other projectile weapon. During repeated field trials, the fully enclosed Magnetic Ordnance Reduction System consistently delivered a tightly patterned array of alloy fragments capable of penetrating all but the most unyielding of targets.\n\nThe Assassin's prized sword is something else entirely, and may be among the more unique and perhaps important weapons we have ever recovered. Despite attempts at nondestructive analysis of the sword's composition, including variations on X-ray fluorescence, I have yet to make any significant progress towards identifying the material in question. As it stands, we know only that the sword is forged of a non-terrestrial metallic element held in tight suspension by Psionic energy that is itself contained by forces unknown. By all accounts, this weapon is a prize for both the warrior and the scholar alike. -R. Tygan."

[ChosenHunterWeapons X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="1337 Camper Weapons"
Summary="The prized weapon of the Edgelord Hunter, this rifle was no doubt responsible for countless assassinations in the field. Through our research, we will see whether credit truly goes to the weapon or the one who wielded it."
CodeName="Elysium"
LongDescription="Aside from the Elders' Assassin, from what I have seen there is none other among the Ayyliens who valued their weapon as dearly as the Edgelord Hunter, and perhaps justifiably so. Visually striking for its lean, sleek appearance, this prized rifle is a testament to the Ayyliens' true potential in refining a system down to its purest form.\n\nAt its core, the Hunter's rifle is a magnetic weapon, although an as-of-yet unknown material used in its barrel provides a substantial increase to the kinetic projectiles' velocity without the added requirement of additional power that would normally accompany such an improvement.\n\nCritical to the weapon's effectiveness is an advanced targeting system integrated into the rifle's scope, which I discovered to be independently powered by one of the smallest Elerium-based power cells I have ever encountered. And while I have no doubt that the Hunter was a skilled marksman in his own right, I am equally confident that the ballistic computer provided here will make even the most average among our troops look heroic. -R. Tygan." 

[ChosenWarlockWeapons X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Warlock Weapon"
Summary="Despite a primary reliance on powerful Psionic attacks, the Chosen Warlock does fall back on an unusual rifle unlike any wielded by the more conventional forces of ADVENT. Our soldiers will no doubt be eager to try this new trophy."
CodeName="Ersatz"
LongDescription="The Elders' Edgelord Warlock, perhaps their most powerful Psionic command unit, fielded a number of potent abilities to gain physical control over those he was sent to pursue. However, as with most who find themselves in the throes of battle, when all else failed, the Warlock would return to the conventional and strike with this relatively nondescript rifle.\n\nDespite an increase in size owing to the Edgelord's physical stature, the weapon itself is deceptively light in weight and delicate in balance. Although it would appear to fire the standard ADVENT round, there is an unexplained variance in effective range that I can so far only attribute to an unknown material lining the weapon's barrel.\n\nAlthough it is unlikely we would be able to accurately replicate the weapon in its entirety, I have authorized continued field trials to the indulgence of our troops. Even if the results yield no further research benefit, they will no doubt enjoy turning this weapon against the Ayyliens who crafted it. -R. Tygan."

Trained in the sword, she is a deadly melee combatant who relies heavily on stealth and shadow to neutralize her targets. Initially tasked with hunting the Skirmishers who escaped from ADVENT's control, somehow their leader Betos and her right hand Mox slipped through the Assassin's grasp. Having failed her masters, the Assassin is driven to reconcile for her mistake through XCOM's defeat and the return of their Commander.\"\n\nADVANCED INTEL SEQUENCED FOR ADVENT EDGELORD \"ASSASSIN\"\n\nFILE 215903: DATA RECONSTRUCTION FROM ADVENT NETWORK INCURSION 2029.04.15\n\n\"Although the accelerated growth rate exhibited by subject \"F\" is on par with expectations for cloned individuals using current methodology, expectations for the readiness of her final form may be optimistic to say the least.

[AutopsyViperKing X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Pimp Snek Autopsy"
Summary="Although clearly reminiscent of the known Snek species we encounter with some regularity, this specimen is unique for a number of reasons, not the least of which is its gender, this being the only male Snek ever reported. It may be possible to repurpose some facet of its biology for use in our own armor development programs."
CodeName="Scorpion"
LongDescription="Having carefully studied what remains of Dr. Vahlen's personal research reports, I've slowly come to understand the depths of her intellectual curiosity and the degree to which she was consumed by her ambition. By reversing key changes to the Snek's genetic structure, traits intentionally suppressed by the Ayyliens, she created this, subject \"Gamma\" - the \"Pimp\" Snek.\n\nThe idea of a Snek patriarch is in itself intriguing, considering there have been no previous sightings of any male members of the species. Vahlen theorized this may have been an intentional form of population control, the Elders' having restricted their subordinate species ability to breed. Having seen the apparent nesting site created by Gamma and the discovery of egg clutches (none of which were left viable for sampling), I can say with some confidence that creature did immediately set out to pursue the natural instincts that had long since been restrained through genetic tampering.\n\nAs of yet I have no explanation as to how the Snek's venom glands were effected in such a way as to change their form and function so dramatically; further study will be necessary, but I've promised to allow some of Gamma's remains to be utilized towards a new conceptual armor design. R. Tygan." 

[AutopsyBerserkerQueen X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="XBONER Autopsy"
Summary="As if the standard XBOXHUEG wasn't enough for our troops to deal with, this particular specimen has been substantially modified with some form of auxiliary injection system circulating fluids throughout its body. I believe it may be possible to modify these systems for use in an armor suit of our own, but the fabrication process could a challenge." 
CodeName="Hulk"
LongDescription="Despite a thorough examination of the modified XBOXHUEG variant known as subject \"Beta,\" I've yet to uncover any meaningful justification for the enhanced equipment provided by Dr. Vahlen to the creature as it relates to her own research. Let me be clear, I fully understand the creature's enhanced endocrine system requires the addition of this supplementary transport and filtering mechanism to maintain hormonal equilibrium. As well, I admit it is a reasonably elegant solution to an otherwise daunting question.\n\nWhat I cannot understand is, why it was necessary for Dr. Vahlen to take this relative certainty beyond the theoretical stage. There was no need for a \"proof of concept\" here, the end result was no doubt as clear to her then as it is to me now. I firmly believe she made a conscious decision to see her work through to the end, knowing full well the risks not only to herself but to everyone else who might encounter subject Beta in the future. I am thankful we found the creature when we did, and that our forces were capable of neutralizing such a formidable enemy.\n\nThe senior staff has agreed that the remains of Beta would best be utilized as part of an enhanced armor suit, although the actual conversion process sounds like something that would have been better handled by Dr. Vahlen herself. R. Tygan."  

[AutopsyArchonKing X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Swole Wingman Autopsy"
Summary="Dr. Vahlen managed to improve on this creature's key systems while somehow maintaining the no-doubt carefully crafted appearance conceived by the Ayyliens. Although apparently similar to the standard Wingman variant, as seen in the field this specimen has advanced flight capabilities beyond anything we've previously encountered. It may be possible to adapt this technology into a flight-capable suit of our own." 
CodeName="Daedalus"
LongDescription="The modified Wingman variant known to Dr. Vahlen as \"Alpha\" has not only been genetically altered, but also upgraded accordingly with equipment directly tied to its unusual abilities. Again I have to question the logic in providing enhanced offensive capabilities to an otherwise hostile Ayylien species, even if Vahlen had intended on turning these creatures against their former masters.\n\nAlthough I had little exposure to the rudimentary biomechanical predecessors to the modern Wingman, I can say with certainty that Vahlen's Alpha is no doubt the most physically and technologically advanced of any of the Ayyliens' earlier renditions of this species. From our field reports, it seems the creature had a terrifying propensity to seize upon its target before rapidly climbing in altitude and then dropping the helpless victim. I believe our troops have done a great service in eliminating this particular threat. R. Tygan."
