LongDescription="By studying the methods used by the aliens to manage energy consumption and heat dissipation in their weapons, we've built a working prototype of what we're calling a pulsed laser weapon, although some of the troops prefer to call them 'blasters' for reasons that are obscure to me. The power we are able to put through these weapons is immense, but the system cannot maintain a continuous beam of such immense energies, so it insted relies on a series of picosecond-long pulses of intense energy density to break down any chemical bonds the beam encounters. These weapons should be more accurate and do more damage, on average, than the ballistic weapons we have been using, although they don't quite match the firepower of the weaponry we have seen the aliens operating.

LongDescription="The principles of coil-type magnetic weapons have long been known, but it has taken our understanding of alien materials and energy supplies to make that a reality. And the reality is we have developed weaponry that exceed the firepower of ADVENT troops and approach that of some alien weaponry. Our coilguns fire rounds sheathed in ablative plastic that melts away as the round travels through the gun barrel at speeds even greater than those achieved by the aliens' railgun-based systems. The round itself can punch through thin armor, as well. R. Tygan."

[AdvancedCoilguns X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Advanced Coilguns"
CodeName="Firefox"
Summary="We can now turn our attention to developing specialized coil weaponry."
LongDescription="The challenges in adapting our new coilgun designs to fit our defined combat roles were not insigificant; the coils themselves must be precisely machined so the round doesn't lose its way in the barrel, which could have catastrophic consequences for the gun and the user. This may explain why ADVENT never adopted this style of weaponry; they are too expensive and labor-intensive to produce, not really suited for industrial-scale production for a worldwide army of poorly trained clones. They are, however, an excellent fit for a small cadre of expert soldiers. R. Tygan."

CodeName="Friedrich"
LongDescription="The fact that we now have access to advanced magnetic weaponry that is both combat effective and safe to operate at these power levels is quite an achievement. The overall design relies on advanced miniaturization technologies developed by the aliens which are, frankly, well beyond anything conceived of by Earth's leading military development firms at the time of the invasion. Despite our limited capability for extended test firings on board the ship, our latest prototypes are already capable of consistently accelerating an adaptive alloy projectile to over 5000 m/s in a simulated environment. We're still preparing the final assessment, but it is likely a field deployable unit would have to be limited to a lower power threshold due to the potential for ongoing strain to our troops when operating the weapons.

With wider coverage, our Havens will be more efficient at their operations, and it will be easier for us to reach some of those outlying regions far off from HQ."
CodeName="Marconi"
LongDescription="The Avenger serves our purposes adequately in terms of coordinating our communications network, but if we hope to increase our range and reach every possible outlet we will have to do more. A series of carefully positioned relay towers would suffice, assuming we can miniaturize the technology we've adapted from the aliens' own communications equipment. It may be difficult to balance the requisite power levels versus the increased chances of detection, but this is our best chance to expand on our capabilities. With the increased coverage, we can expect the efficiency of local resistance operations to improve, strengthening the groups working within range of the towers. R. Tygan."

[PlatedArmor X2TechTemplate]

Summary="Our understanding of the ADVENT armor is far enough along to allow for the fabrication of our own design mirroring their plated structure. The initial prototypes may be aesthetically rough, but functionally they'll be both light and strong."
CodeName="Yorrick"
LongDescription="We've recovered enough of the ADVENT armor to begin repurposing the outer plates into something better suited to our soldiers. The material itself seems to be the same as what the aliens utilized throughout the Avenger's hull, an extremely durable substance with an unusual ambient magnetic property. As an armor component, the magnetic fields surrounding these plates will actually provide additional protection against magnetic-based weaponry, most notably the gauss weaponry commonly equipped by ADVENT. R. Tygan."

[EXOSuit X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Battle Armor"
Summary="If we combine the power-assisted armor prototypes we've been working on with some of the ADVENT plating we've recovered, we could develop a variant of our plated armor that allows us to add a heavy weapon mount directly to the armor, combining significant defensive and offensive capabilities in a single suit."
CodeName="Stark"
LongDescription="For the aliens, fielding heavier weapons, or more of them, usually means using a larger, heavier alien species to haul the gear into battle. For our needs, we have to rely on something more practical. I've been working on a variety of power-assisted armor prototypes, which, at the very least, should provide a means for our troops to bring another weapon into the fight. By combining these prototypes with the alien alloy plating we've experimented with previously, the armor should be almost as durable as our Predator prototypes. L. Shen."
UnlockedDescription="Prototype added to inventory"

[SpiderSuit X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Mobile Armor"
Summary="Spotty records from the ruined mainframe at XCOM HQ indicate an early prototype for a light armor suit coupled with a grappling hook never came to fruition. Our recent mastery of the aliens' materials may allow us to revive the concept." 
CodeName="Fisher"
LongDescription="With the variety of environments our forces are currently engaging the enemy in, we need to give them every opportunity to gain a tactical advantage in the field. With that in mind, our latest armor prototype incorporates a basic powered-ascent mechanism capable of propelling the wearer to heights of over 10m with high levels of stability. The suit utilizes a number of micro-servo motors operating in sequence to aid in distributing the load throughout the armor, with the added side-effect of enhanced reflexes provided to the wearer. Although Central has made vague references to the previous science officer serving XCOM, he doesn't seem interested in discussing her efforts with me directly. I'm guessing the grapple design was something she created in collaboration with dad before XCOM fell. L. Shen."

[PoweredArmor X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Powered Armor"
Summary="Having found various means of integrating the alien materials within designs better suited to our own troops, I think it may be possible to assemble armor made entirely of the recovered alloys and powered by an Elerium cell. It should be incredibly strong, and able to withstand even direct hits from most alien weaponry."
CodeName="Goliath"
LongDescription="From what we've seen of the aliens' activities and their lack of regard for human life, preserving those of us that are still around has to become a task of equal importance to eliminating the alien threat itself. The success of this entire undertaking hinges on our ability to keep our soldiers healthy and ready for battle at a moment's notice. In working towards that aim, our latest armor prototype utilizes more of the alien alloys than any we've previously assembled, and as expected the durability and potential for damage mitigation is extremely impressive. Initial trials show the armor to be capable of withstanding a direct hit from focused plasma at 5m, enough so to increase survivability by a substantial margin. I plan on advising the senior staff not to inform the troops of any perceived toughness associated with the suit, I would hate for our forces to grow reliant on it despite our best intentions. L. Shen."

[WraithSuit X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Shadow Armor"
Summary="Having seen the aliens manipulating Psionic fields for a variety of purposes, we've theorized it may be possible to traverse through the physical confines of our world by developing a Psionic field enmeshed in a specially designed light armor suit."
CodeName="Loki"
LongDescription="Even though we're learning more about the alien's varying uses for the Psionic energy fields they manipulate, so far we haven't spent much time trying to harness these capabilities for our own purposes. Direct access to the biomechanical alien we've been calling the \"Codex\" has given us far better insight into the nature of Psionics than any of our previous experimentation. The Codex has the unique ability to phase through not just physical objects, but between worlds, and, in theory, dimensions. By focusing a carefully balanced pulse of Psionic energy, the Codex creates a rift, effectively peeling back the layers of spacetime. The possible implications of this ability are mind bobbling, but it's safe to say I won't be recommending we pursue this advance to the Commander. However, there are other areas of interest tied Codex. During our testing, we conceived of the possibility that the Psionic pulse could be diverted, or scattered, across an electromagnetic field integrated into a suit of armor. This would effectively create a weakened rift throughout the suit, allowing the wearer to phase through objects within our own dimension. The prototype is stable, but field trials are ongoing. L. Shen."

Summary="By harnessing the power of Elerium, it may be possible to create a new powered-armor suit capable of generating a defensive force field not unlike those used on the alien craft."
CodeName="Titan"
LongDescription="With our supply of Elerium crystals limited by what our soldiers can recover in the field, I've been hesitant to recommend we commit them to any one project exclusively. However, in the wake of recent events, it seems like we need to work on developing an armor suit with significant durability and the ability to mount a heavy weapon. In order to do that, we've integrated an Elerium-based power cell into one our stronger frames. With the Elerium's incredible energy throughput, the suit can now support the use a self-contained force field. In the simplest of terms, we've mirrored the technologies most commonly used by the aliens in the defense of their UFOs, and fused them with a platform our troops can deploy in the field. I expect great things from this unit. L. Shen."

[Header_RESISTANCE X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="LONG WAR 2 CONCEPTS: RESISTANCE HAVENS"

[OutpostManagement_General X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Haven Management"
DescriptionTitle="Haven Management"
DescriptionEntry="In Long War 2, the Commander will take over management of the worldwide Resistance movement against the ADVENT administration. In regions XCOM has made contact with, you will use the Haven Management screen to direct the priorities of Resistance cells. Individual Resistance members will be listed on this screen. Resistance members can be assigned to one of four tasks: SUPPLY, RECRUIT, INTEL or HIDING. Note that rebels assigned to new jobs will not begin work until the following day. "

[OutpostManagement_Supply X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="The Supply Job"
DescriptionTitle="The Supply Job"
DescriptionEntry="Resistance personnel on the SUPPLY job are focused on scavenging supplies from around their regions. More rebels assigned to the Supply job will mean a larger Supply drop each month. Note that over time in a given region, the Supply job will grow less effective as the Resistance scrounges the most easily recovered materiel."

[OutpostManagement_Recruit X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="The Recruit Job"
DescriptionTitle="The Recruit Job"
DescriptionEntry="Resistance members assigned to the RECRUIT job are busy in the communities looking for volunteers willing to join the Resistance. Recruits may either join the local Haven or, if they have potential as an XCOM trooper, they will enter the pool of potential recruits for soldier training. More rebels assigned to the Recruit job will mean faster recruiting of both Resistance members and soldiers. If recruiting in a liberated region, you have a small chance to find a scientist or engineer willing to work for XCOM."

[OutpostManagement_Intel X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="The Intel Job"
DescriptionTitle="The Intel Job"
DescriptionEntry="Resistance members put on the INTEL job will look for information on ADVENT and alien operations. They will generate a small income of the intel resource, but their main function is to detect alien activities and alert XCOM to vulnerabilities in the enemy security network, leading to mission alerts which XCOM can send troops on. More Resistance members on the intel job will detect more missions, and they will often detect them more quickly than they otherwise would. This gives your troops more time to infiltrate those targets, which is vital to generating survivable missions. IMPORTANT: The Avenger can assist greatly in the Intel job in a single region. Scanning at the Resistance Haven site will produce intel and missions equivalent to the contributions of several unpromoted Resistance members."

[OutpostManagement_Hiding X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="The Hiding Job"
DescriptionTitle="The Hiding Job"
DescriptionEntry="Resistance members who are put in the HIDING job will produce no resources, but they will also avoid any unwanted attention from ADVENT. Busy Havens are more likely to attract ADVENT retaliatory strikes, so putting rebels on the Hiding job will lower the Haven's profile. ADVENT will more rapidly lose interest in regions with numerous Resistance members in hiding, or with few Resistance members overall, and will be less likely to move troops in."

[OutpostManagement_Capacity X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Haven Operating Capacity"
DescriptionTitle="Haven Operating Capacity"
DescriptionEntry="Each Haven only has the capacity for maximum of 13 Resistance members at that Haven to be assigned to the SUPPLY, RECRUIT, or INTEL jobs; the rest will be treated as reserves and put in the HIDING job."

[OutpostManagement_Reprisals X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="ADVENT Reprisals"
DescriptionTitle="ADVENT Reprisals"
DescriptionEntry="In retaliations and similar missions, Resistance members will appear during tactical combat. Depending on the operation, they may sometimes be armed, although they will be less effective than XCOM soldiers in combat. XCOM soldiers are also sometimes required to activate a Resistance member by moving close to them, giving the player control of their actions, so they can move to escape areas as necessary. In addition, XCOM can recover certain ADVENT assets and repurpose them for Haven defense, granting additional units to assist in combat."

[OutpostManagement_Promotions X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Resistance Promotions"
DescriptionTitle="Resistance Promotions"
DescriptionEntry="Over time, Resistance members can become better at their jobs. Resistance members who have gained a level will be marked with an asterisk on the Haven Management Screen. Expert members who have gained a second level will be marked with an additional asterisk. These promoted rebels will produce more results on any job they are assigned to, and they will also receive XCOM perks for use in combat."

[OutpostManagement_Advisers X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="XCOM Advisers"
DescriptionTitle="XCOM Advisers"
DescriptionEntry="XCOM may assign a single adviser from its staff to each Haven to assist in various tasks. The adviser may be assigned by clicking the photo frame in the top-left of the Haven Management screen. Assigning an engineer will generate bonuses for the Supply job in the region. Assigning a scientist will generate bonuses to the Intel job. Assigning a soldier will generate bonuses to the Recruit job; the soldier will also appear on combat missions involving Haven personnel. The soldier will also hunt for any ADVENT infiltrators in the Haven. Higher-ranking soldiers will generate more bonuses. The soldier should be outfitted with gear on the Avenger BEFORE departing for the Haven. If a Resistance Haven is entirely wiped out by enemy action, the only way to recruit new rebels is to station a soldier in the region. Advisers may be unassigned from the Haven by clicking on their portrait, as long as ADVENT doesn't have any active reprisals against the Resistance underway in the region."

[Header_INFILTRATION X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="LONG WAR 2 CONCEPTS: INFILTRATION"

[Infiltration_Help1 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Infiltration Summary"
DescriptionTitle="Infiltration Summary"
DescriptionEntry="Many of XCOM's offensive operations require infiltration of the target site over a period of several days. Infiltrating a mission site represents XCOM forces concealing themselves from ADVENT patrols and gathering intelligence on enemy activities. This careful preparation allows XCOM to strike when the time is right. During infiltrations, the XCOM forces will not be available for other missions, unless you abort the infiltration and return the troops to base, canceling any progress you have made. XCOM may have multiple infiltrations underway at once. Properly infiltrating these sites is crucial to conducting missions that XCOM can win."

[Infiltration_Help2 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Infiltration Missions"
DescriptionTitle="Infiltration Missions"
DescriptionEntry="These missions use an INFILTRATION START button at the top center of the Squad Select screen. After selecting your squad and beginning an infiltration, the mission pin on the Geoscape will show a percent-infiltrated value ranging from 0 to 200%. The more the squad infiltrates a site, the fewer enemy units it will face on the mission. This is the critical role infiltration plays in Long War 2."

[Infiltration_Help3 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Infiltration Progress"
DescriptionTitle="Infiltration Progress"
DescriptionEntry="While it is possible to launch an attack on many of these sites immediately, the squad could face two to three times as many enemies without properly preparing for the mission. The amount of extra forces is indicated by the Enemy Readiness description in the Infiltration Options panel, which can be Impregnable, Fortified, Alerted, Guarded, Normal and Vulnerable. There are invisible gradations within these categories, so every additional hour spent infiltrating makes it more likely XCOM will face a lesser enemy force. More time spent infiltrating also reduces the time the Skyranger takes to arrive when the squad throws an evac flare. Note that some critical missions require at least 100% infiltration before the mission may be launched."

[Infiltration_Help4 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Enemy Activity"
DescriptionTitle="Enemy Activity"
DescriptionEntry="The impact on enemy forces is also noted in the Current and Baseline enemy activity readouts in Squad Select and the infiltration panels. These descriptions, such as \"light,\" \"heavy,\" or \"swarming\" indicate how many enemies you are likely to face, not counting any reinforcements the aliens are able to summon. The baseline enemy activity description, reported when the mission is first detected and in the Squad Selection screen, represents the expected enemy force level if you infiltrate to 100%. The current enemy activity level is what it would be if you launched the mission at that moment. You can gain further bonuses by infiltrating to 200%, although no mission will drop below \"Extremely Light\" activity, and the benefits accumulate much more slowly after exceeding 100%."

[Infiltration_Help5 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Boosting Infiltrations"
DescriptionTitle="Boosting Infiltrations"
DescriptionEntry="Once per infiltration, the Commander may also assist an infiltration by electing to spend some of XCOM's Intel resource. Using the \"Boost Infiltration\" button in the Infiltration Options panel will give you the option of spending 25 intel to significantly increase the rate of infiltration. You can use this option at any time during the infiltration, as its benefits apply retroactively."

[Infiltration_Help6 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Managing Infiltration Time"
DescriptionTitle="Managing Infiltration Time"
DescriptionEntry="The Commander has some control over the amount of time it takes to infiltrate a mission site by using smaller or larger squads and by selecting certain soldier perks and gear. This is represented by information presented in the Squad Select screen. The \"Base Infiltration\" value is how many days a typical XCOM squad of five soldiers will take to infiltrate the site to 100%. The Squad Size modifier value is the impact of the currently selected squad size. The stealth modifier is the impact of abilities and gear. Certain perks, particularly Infiltrator and Tradecraft, lower infiltration time. Units carrying submachine guns and certain other specialized stealth gear can further lower it. Meanwhile, heavy weapons soldiers will increase the squad's infiltration time."

[Infiltration_Help7 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Mission Expiration"
DescriptionTitle="Mission Expiration"
DescriptionEntry="Many missions also expire; the time left until expiration is noted in the Mission Expiration value in the Squad Select screen. The earlier the local Resistance Haven's intel section detects an enemy operation, the more time XCOM will have until the mission expires. This will often prevent squads from reaching 100% infiltration. When a mission is expiring on the Geoscape, an alert will give the Commander the choice of going in at the current infiltration level or aborting."

[ResistanceManagement X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Resistance Management"
DescriptionTitle="Resistance Management"
DescriptionEntry="The Resistance management panel allows XCOM to direct the activities of Resistance cells around the world. New Resistance Havens will appear here as contact is established, along with a summary of their current strength and activities. Selecting a region will take you the appropriate Haven management panel (see below)."

[SquadManagement X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Squad Management"
DescriptionTitle="Squad Management"
DescriptionEntry="The squad manager lets you organize squads of troops who can be assigned as a group to a particular mission. Squads operate under the following guidelines:<br/><Bullet/> Up to 12 soldiers may be assigned to a squad, and squads may be chosen in the squad select interface immediately before a mission.<br/><Bullet/> If a squad member is wounded, in training or just not a good fit for a mission, you can substitute in a temporary squad member from the pool of unassigned soldiers on a mission-by-mission basis.<br/><Bullet/> You may also build a squad entirely from unassigned members just before a mission; they will be given a name (for reference on the Geoscape), and that squad will be disbanded as soon as the mission is over.<br/><Bullet/> To transfer soldiers from one permanent squad to another, they must first be unassigned from their current squad."

[ExperiencePoints X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Soldier Experience"
DescriptionTitle="Soldier Experience"
DescriptionEntry="Soldiers gain experience and levels primarily by going on missions, with a smaller portion coming directly from the soldier individually killing enemies. Mission XP is based on how many enemies are present on the map at the beginning of a tactical mission, and it is divided equally among the troops after the mission if it is successful, regardless of how many enemies were killed. Note this means that sending fewer soldiers on a mission will result in them receiving a greater share of the mission XP. If XCOM fails to achieve its objectives during the mission, a smaller amount of shared mission XP is rewarded based on how many enemies were killed, with the maximum capped at 50% of what a successful mission would have provided."

[Liberation X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Liberating Regions"
DescriptionTitle="Liberating Regions"
DescriptionEntry="The Resistance, with sufficient help from XCOM, may now liberate regions entirely from ADVENT control. They must detect and undertake a series of increasingly difficult missions to do this, culminating with strikes on ADVENT's power centers in the region. The aliens will undertake almost no activities in liberated regions unless they attempt to retake it. The Resistance will generate bonus supplies, recruits and intel for XCOM in liberated regions. Any active infiltrations in a region that is liberated will receive a significant bonus to infiltration percentage, and then the Commander will have to decide whether to go on that mission immediately or abort before ADVENT retreats its forces to neighboring regions. Liberating a region should give the Resistance sufficient access to ADVENT infrastructure that we may begin to discover the aliens' true purpose on Earth before it is too late."

[AlienForces X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Alien and ADVENT Forces"
DescriptionTitle="Alien and ADVENT Forces"
DescriptionEntry="As powerful as they are, the aliens do have limits on their capabilities. They have spread their forces around the globe in an attempt to engage the Resistance, and some places they are stronger than others. Our intelligence teams provide estimates of enemy strengths in each contacted region; that strength will change over time as ADVENT moves troops to areas of high XCOM and Resistance activity, leaving other areas potentially vulnerable. Missions in regions which have heavy ADVENT presence will be far more difficult in areas they are not giving much attention to."

[Corpses X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Enemy Corpses"
DescriptionTitle="Enemy Corpses"
DescriptionEntry="Because of many of our missions require rapid exfiltration from a battle site, we are often unable to collect the remains of our ADVENT and alien enemies for research or rendering into useful alien materials. Offensive missions that offer the possibility to gather enemy corpses should be made a priority."

[AlienTactics X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Enemy Tactics"
DescriptionTitle="Enemy Tactics"
DescriptionEntry="Unless they are assigned to attack or protect a particular target, ADVENT and their alien allies will patrol a combat zone. If they patrol into XCOM on the alien turn, they have a chance to take certain defensive actions after they scatter. During their patrols, if they hear weapons fire or explosions, see a corpse, or hear yelling civilians, they may go into a higher state of alert. If they are in a heightened state of alert and they encounter XCOM on their turn, they may take certain offensive actions, including shooting, after their scatter move as long as they are unwounded. Note that heavy weapons and explosives may alert enemies at greater distances than other weapons, while melee weapons are only audible at very short ranges."

[TrainingOfficers X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Officer Training"
DescriptionTitle="Officer Training"
DescriptionEntry="The Guerrilla Tactics school contains up to two slots for you to pick soldiers from the armory and train them as officers. Officers may gain a number of special abilities to assist on missions, but only one officer may go on a mission at a time. You may begin selecting officers from your soldiers who have reached corporal rank. Officers have a Command Range that increases with their officer rank; it determines the distance at which many of their abilities are effective."

[Sharpshooter_LWS X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Sharpshooter Class"
DescriptionTitle="Sharpshooter Class"
DescriptionEntry="Relying primarily on high-powered rifles to eliminate hostile targets from long distances, Sharpshooters may specialize as a sniper capable of long-range ambushes, or as a mobile marksman who can target enemies from just behind our front lines. Sharpshooters are also equipped with the Holo-Targeter, a device used to designate targets for the rest of XCOM."

[Assault_LWS X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Assault Class"
DescriptionTitle="Assault Class"
DescriptionEntry="Our assaults trace some ancestry to pre-war police Special Weapons and Tactics personnel, along with soldiers who specialized in urban counterinsurgencies shorly before the alien invasion. They typically carry a shotgun as their primary weapon and can specialize in combat or survival abilities. For long-distance work, they carry the arc thrower, an improved version of the XCOM weapon devised during the invasion's early days that is capable of stunning targets."

[Specialist_LWS X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Specialist Class"
DescriptionTitle="Specialist Class"
DescriptionEntry="Using salvaged alien technology, Shen has managed incredible advances in robotics, allowing XCOM's Specialists to field the highly advanced drones known affectionately as GREMLINs.

DescriptionTitle="Stopping The ADVENT CALENDAR"
DescriptionEntry="While we have limited understanding of the nature of the aliens' work, we do know that every successful battle we fight against them forces them to divert resources away from Avatar and toward pacifying Earth. That gives us more time to learn about the nature of the project and find ways to stop it."

[RadioRelays X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
DescriptionEntry="Constructing Radio Relays will extend the range from which we can contact new, previously unexplored regions. Building relays at the edges of our current reach will provide the greatest benefit in terms of added range. Radio Relays make rebels more effective at their jobs, and the Intel cost of contacting neighboring regions will be reduced. IMPORTANT: To build a Radio Relay, navigate the Avenger to the region in which you wish to build a tower; open the Haven Management window by clicking the tower icon in the region, and select the BUILD RADIO RELAY button in the top-right corner of the window."

[BlackMarket X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
DescriptionEntry="The Black Market provides access to a basic storefront operated by a network of smugglers operating outside of the ADVENT administration. XCOM can buy additional materials using supplies. Unwanted items can also be sold."

[Avenger X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
DescriptionEntry="Serving as XCOM's mobile headquarters, the Avenger was once a basic transport vessel utilized by the aliens during the invasion. Shot down and disabled by forces unknown, the ship was apparently abandoned by the aliens, only to be discovered by Dr. Raymond Shen who first proposed an attempt at reclaiming the vessel for XCOM. Although many facets of the alien technology remain a mystery, the ship itself is now reliably under XCOM's control and has proven to be crucial to the resurgent Resistance movement.<br/><br/>One of the most important roles of the Avenger is to assist in scanning for missions in a given region. Scanning at a Haven provides a significant bonus to Intel gathered there."

[Concealment X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
DescriptionEntry="With limited tactical resources, XCOM has to rely on stealth to gain the upper hand on our enemies. Many operations begin with the XCOM squad in concealment. By avoiding the enemy's detection radius, XCOM can remain concealed until they reach the mission objective. Various factors can impact enemy detection radii, including what gear XCOM is carrying and abilities they have trained."

[EVAC X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="EVAC"
DescriptionTitle="EVAC"
DescriptionEntry="XCOM can request an emergency evacuation from the battlefield at the Commander's discretion. Once the Skyranger has been contacted, the soldier making the call will need to select a rendezvous point for the evacuation to occur. Doing so will reveal the squad if it is concealed. Once placed, the squad will need to move into the designated EVAC volume and request a rope out. Note that the Skyranger may take some time to arrive: if XCOM has many infiltrations active around the globe, has poorly infiltrated this particular mission, or has a large squad, expect to have to defend the evac zone until the Skyranger can arrive."

Soldiers elgible for extra training can select abilities in one of three categories: offensive, defensive and pistol. For offensive and defensive abilities, soldiers may train up to three abilities in each category. The abilities are randomly generated for each soldier, but the abilities unlocked after finishing a training segment will generally be stronger than the previous ones. For pistol abilities, soldiers may train all seven, given enough time."

Although the towers themselves are a readily identifiable fixture to those people living in the city centers, its overall function and the extent of its capabilities are still generally unknown. It is widely believed that the ADVENT Peacekeeping forces in a given region are coordinated from somewhere within the regional tower. We also believe that a master tower somewhere serves as the hub for distributing information and commands to all of the regional towers. Capturing a regional tower will give the Resistance a working radio relay for the region."

DisplayName="ADVENT /k/ommando Autopsy"
Summary="Aside from the variety of fascinating genetic enhancements found in the ADVENT Mall Ninjas, the /k/ommandos appear to be augmented further with some kind of biomechanical implant. I believe this allows for some form of communication throughout the ayylien hierarchy. If we were to somehow tap into this system, I wonder, what memes might we hear?"
LongDescription="Physically larger and more tactically capable than the subordinate Mall Ninjas, the ADVENT /k/ommandos administer a system of control over the Mall Ninjas through a carefully engineered Psionic link augmented with a mechanical implant. From my initial examination of the Commander and a careful review of the information gathered in the Ayylien containment area, I now have a theory as to how this system was established.\n\n It is my firm belief that this process of Psionic control was specifically engineered to allow rapid deployment of tactical memes drawn directly from the subconscious mind - in this case, the mind of our very own Commander. With this hierarchy in place, tactical memetics stored in the depths of the Commander's mind was processed and transmitted to the ADVENT /k/ommando's, who in turn directed the Mall Ninjas and other subordinates. With the Commander no longer attached to their Psionic network, it's difficult to say how the orders are being dispersed at this point - although I'm sure the ayyliens have planned for this potential contingency.\n\n I believe it may be possible to tap into this \"Network,\" but it would require the use of a living ADVENT /k/ommando to function as our conduit. To facilitate this difficult task, we've worked to develop a new device, the "Skullfucker," which should be capable of disabling a /k/ommando. From there, it's simply a matter of hacking the /k/ommando in the field - although I won't speculate as to the outcome. R. Tygan."

[AlienEncryption X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Ayylien Encryption"
Summary="Unlike the conventional encryption methods we would typically encounter with terrestrial data stores, the ayyliens appear to be using an advanced matrix consisting of both mechanical and biological cyphers, combined with some form of Psionic interference. The thought of uncovering the ayyliens' most complex memes is both intriguing and frightening in equal measure."
LongDescription="Before we can even begin to attempt decrypting the ayylien meme stores, we must first come to understand the means by which they protect their most valuable memes. It was immediately clear that the ayyliens do not rely solely on conventional algorithms, but instead use a complex matrix of interwoven biological signatures as part of the cypher itself. An additional layer of protection is afforded by an ongoing field of Psionic interference, tied directly into the ADVENT network itself. If we're to have any chance of defeating the multiple safeguards the ayyliens have in place, it's likely we'll have to design specialized equipment to isolate each layer of encryption before we attempt to press on with our investigation. R. Tygan."

[CodexBrainPt1 X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Computer Waifu Brain"
Summary="This biomechanical component, what we've referred to as the \"Brain,\" is all that remains of the Computer Waifu our forces encountered in the field. We should endeavor to extract whatever information we can, time is of the essence."
LongDescription="The Computer Waifu itself is a remarkable entity, far beyond our expectations of what a sentient, biological organism could or should be. Our limited exposure to it leaves a number of open questions, and as it appears to phase or flux out of our visible spectrum, it will undoubtedly prove to be a difficult specimen to study. In any case, our troops were able to recover what can only be described as the Computer Waifu \"Brain,\" a central processing unit encompassing data storage, communications, tactical control, as well as a host of other functions we've yet to identify.\n\nWith the Shadow Chamber in place, Shen and I conducted a thorough, albeit difficult series of experiments to unravel the mysteries of the device. Through a series of high-frequency exposures, we were successful in forcing the Computer Waifu to reveal itself, beyond the confines of the Brain alone. Shen expressed varying concerns about the well-being of the Computer Waifu, as it appeared to be responding, and even resisting, our efforts to decrypt the data and access the ADVENT network. I assured her any indication of pain or active intolerance of our testing was merely a byproduct of the procedure. Before the Computer Waifu destroyed itself, along with our containment area, we did manage to recover a subset of the data containing what appears to be a set of map coordinates. It will take more time to work through the remaining fragments, but in the interim we have a lead to pursue. R. Tygan."

[CodexBrainPt2 X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Encrypted Computer Waifu Data"
Summary="Our initial efforts to delve into the Computer Waifu Brain data provided us with a sequence of map coordinates. However, we still have fragments of data that the Computer Waifu attempted to destroy, which would imply a value to this data far beyond what we've discovered so far."
LongDescription="With time set aside to further analyze the data fragments leftover from our initial Computer Waifu experiment, I've finally managed to crack their code - and the resulting data is perhaps more valuable, and shocking, than I had expected. I understand now why the Computer Waifu was willing to sacrifice itself to protect this information.\n\nIn the shadows, the ayylien overseers, known to us as the "Elders," have continued to work in secret since the very beginnings of ADVENT. Although Central Officer Bradford tells me that no one has seen an Elder in the flesh for over a decade, we continue to see monuments in their likeness throughout the city centers. This is because they never left: they simply fell into the shadows, focusing their efforts on a more dire concern - the Elders are dying.\n\nAmong the diverse and widely varied ayylien specimens we've encountered, the Elders are uniquely afflicted by some form of Space AIDS. Their physical forms are no longer capable of containing the Psionic energy that is the Elders' lifeblood. Just as we've encountered these unique ayylien species in the field, at some point in the past, the Elders encountered them as well - and used them in an attempt to cure this plague among their own kind. Unfortunately for them, and for us, it seems they've never found this cure, and now it appears they are looking to use humanity as their next candidate. R. Tygan."

Summary="The map coordinate data recovered from the Computer Waifu brain led us to this: a powerful Psionic artifact embedded deep in the wilderness. The question is: if this is truly a gateway, then what lies on the other side?"
CodeName="Heiroglyph"
LongDescription="Although the logistical concerns involved in transporting a large piece of potentially unstable ayylien technology were difficult to manage, they are easily dwarfed by the risks involved in attempting to operate this device within the confines of the Avenger. Although Shen and I both had our concerns, given the directives of our operation, we saw little alternative but to begin experimenting on this Gateway as soon as possible.\n\nAfter a period of slow, deliberate power increases accompanied by the appropriate level of monitoring, we felt comfortable enough to leave the Gateway operating in its idle state. At that point, we conducted a series of simple tests on various objects to better understand how the ayyliens use the device for transportation. Initially, we saw no means of actually putting the Gateway into an active state. That is to say, the Gateway itself seemed to disregard or ignore the objects we passed through.\n\nHaving studied the ayylien Computer Waifu and its ability to open rifts in the field for deployment, we theorized the Gateway may be tied to a similar signal or key integrated into the Computer Waifu itself. Sure enough, by mirroring the frequencies found in close proximity to the Computer Waifu, we found that the Gateway itself enters a second, active condition.\n\nShen was hesitant to relegate her pet GREMLIN to use in our experiment, but she recognized the value in having a remote test subject, and we had no other units available to spare. Unfortunately, our initial theories as to the Gateway's function overlooked the possibility that it was also tied to the biological components of the Computer Waifu. Shen's personal GREMLIN suffered some relatively minor damage during our test, but its sacrifice led to an important revelation in terms of how we might access this Gateway and discover its source.

CodeName="Primarch"
LongDescription="We have dedicated the entirety of our efforts to discovering the purpose of the Advent Calendar, and now, it seems we're finally gaining ground on the ayyliens. With that said, I was shocked to see that our troops not only encountered what was apparently a fully responsive Super Saiyan specimen, but that it engaged them in combat and was subsequently dispatched with only moderate difficulty.\n\nWith all that went in to its creation, somehow I expected that the Super Saiyan wouldnt be such a bitch. Initially, it appeared as though my assumptions were wrong.\n\nHumanoid in form, the physical attributes of the Super Saiyan specimen are, on the surface, wholly unremarkable. It has a musculature system not all that unlike a young adult human, with no obvious genetic adulterations to enhance its physical strength or agility. At this point I could only surmise that the ayyliens focused entirely on what lies beneath the Avatar's seemingly ordinary structure.\n\nAs I continued my analysis of the Avatar specimen, including a rapid genetic sequencing aided by the Shadow Chamber, I discovered my earlier conclusions could not be further from the truth. This Avatar, what was left of it, is still not \"whole\" in a developmental sense. Although portions of the missing genetic links have since been filled with what is undoubtedly Elder DNA, there are still gaps; incomplete sequences that leave the creature unable to fully sustain its own power. It is now my firm belief that we have yet to encounter a fully developed Super Saiyan, and its potential capabilities at full strength leave me deeply concerned. R. Tygan."

Codename="Nano"
LongDescription="With little time to prepare, we were forced to conduct an extremely invasive procedure on the Commander in order remove what appeared to be an implant carefully enmeshed within the occipital lobe. Although all indications were that the device was not designed for removal, concerns as to the Commander's potential longevity, and the risk of possible remote manipulation by the ayyliens, left us with little alternative.\n\nDespite my concerns, the Commander has so far felt no lasting effects from the procedure and appears to be recovering ahead of expectations. As for the chip itself, my initial findings are alarming, to say the least. The device is Psionically-driven by the latent energy of the subject's brain, in this case, the Commander. More importantly, it appears the device functions as both a transmitter and receiver, relaying information via some form of Psionic link.\n\nEven after removal, I've had to shield the device to contain the residual Psionic fields surrounding the implant itself, for fear of what it might be capable of. If my current theory is correct, the Commander may have played a more important role in ADVENT's operations than we could have possibly imagined. R. Tygan."

CodeName="Keksburg"
LongDescription="Preliminary autopsy exam conducted by Dr. Richard Tygan, acting science officer. Although my direct surgical experience is limited, the ayyliens' genetic manipulation of the species previously catalogued as a Pectoid provides a certain familiarity in relation to human anatomy. While the earliest documented accounts of Pectoids on earth indicated examples no larger than one meter in height, the specimens we encounter today are all nearly twice that size. Knowing full well that the ayyliens continue their efforts to integrate human and ayylien DNA, my findings here only reinforce the notion of a continuous development process. This larger Pectoid variant has an even greater proportion of human genetic material, selectively combined with the intention of improving the otherwise limited physical capabilities of the original. With enhanced Psionic capabilities and greater overall strength, I'd say they've succeeded. R. Tygan."

CodeName="Strangle"
LongDescription="I find it truly remarkable how adaptable some of the ayylien species' genetics are to the constant \"tweaks\" they're often subjected to. In the case of the \"Snek,\" a species once identified as the infiltration unit known as a \"Thin Mint,\" the ayyliens have made a conscious reduction in their efforts to disguise its true form. Without the introduction of extensive human genetic material, the Snek reverts to a purely reptilian form while apparently retaining the same intellect and combat aptitude. The Snek's snake-like form is in many ways similar to the legless reptiles we commonly encounter on Earth. The enhanced torso musculature allows for upright mobility, and the addition of two physically weak but capable arms allows for the handling of traditional weaponry. Of the many ayylien species our troops encounter in the field, I find the prospect of encountering an intelligent snake standing over 2 meters tall to be among the most disturbing. R. Tygan."

LongDescription="Having never seen any of the previous Dickhead variants personally - no homo -, I can only go by the stories I've heard from Central Officer Bradford and others. As they say, the current breed is apparently on the smaller side, although considerably more agile than the originals. Internally, the subject maintains all the hallmarks of extensive genetic modification, with additional musculature and bone protecting the internal organs from any risk of direct contact. The ayyliens clearly spent a great deal of time and effort honing the abilities of the Dickhead as a hard, unyielding monolith in battle. I had heard that our soldiers believe the Dickheads to be part of a tribal society, at least originally, based on their unusual battle cries and markings seen in the field. Having finally gotten a closer look, I can confirm the presence of unusual scarification that could certainly be attributed to ritualistic behavior of some kind. R. Tygan."

CodeName="Ragnarok"
LongDescription="This species was quickly tagged by our forces in the field as a \"XBOXHUEG,\" based on its overwhelmingly large presence on the battlefield. Upon initial examination, it's difficult to ignore the extreme muscle growth present throughout the specimen, leaving little need for extensive armor or even conventional weaponry for that matter. I suspect the added bulk of the subject to be the direct result of an intentional protein deficiency engineered by the ayyliens explicitly to create the hulking mass we see today. As for its behavior, I can only infer that was intended as well, as the ayyliens are well within their capability to manipulate the endocrine glands or equivalent for the purposes of hormonal behavioral control. In any case, this is an extremely dangerous and unstable species, best avoided by our troops at anything other than long range. R. Tygan."

LongDescription="Having encountered a number of ayyliens capable of wielding Psionic power, it should come as no surprise that their aptitude and abilities are often unique to a given species. In this case the subject henceforth referred to as the \"Pokéball\", is on the extreme end of the spectrum in terms of Psionic sensitivity.\n\nHowever, our efforts to analyze the subject have so far revealed little in terms of its actual purpose or intention in the field.

LongDescription="Although I was extremely hesitant to perform an autopsy on this creature before an extensive analysis of the fumes vented with regularity from its suit, my concerns were overruled by the rest of the senior staff due to our overbearing time constraints. It was with some relief that I discovered the most common element to be Argon, an otherwise harmless gas when handled properly. Although similar in size and physical structure to the Dickhead species, the \"Big Daddy\" as it's come to be known does not appear to be of the same genetic design as the Dickhead. I stress design here because perhaps more so than all but the most extreme examples, the Big Daddy was engineered to exist only within the confines of the environmental suit we see them wearing in the field. Destruction of this protective equipment results in a reaction similar to what we might see if a human astronaut were to remove their helmet in space - that is to say, a painful and unpleasant death within minutes.

CodeName="Protean"
LongDescription="Early reports from the resistance referencing an ayylien creature said to be capable of \"shapeshifting\" were initially dismissed by local cell leaders who attributed the sightings to lonely nights and wishful thinking. It wasn't until our own forces engaged with the creature that we successfully confirmed its existence. Surprisingly enough, the description of the creature from those early reports was quite accurate.\n\nWith a varying height of up to three meters, the specimen currently referred to as the \"Fellow Human\" has one of the most unusual internal structures I've ever encountered. Where one might expect to find a skeletal foundation, we instead see a series of malleable chitin-like structures providing various points for the expansion of several equally unusual fluid membranes.\n\nThe membranes in question are responsible for the Fellow Human's extraordinary ability to mirror the form of a human. In recirculating key cellular combinations via an elaborate internal structure, the Fellow Human is capable of forming solid shapes while also mirroring colors and textures without physical sampling. As of yet we've only seen evidence of the Fellow Human attempting to imitate humans, but not other species or inanimate objects. Whether or not this is a limitation of their genetic makeup, or an intentional manipulation of their abilities by the ayyliens, we cannot say at this time. R. Tygan."

Summary="They may have features resembling a variety of terrestrial insect species, but these creatures are deadlier than anything bred of our world. Their armored exoskeleton is of particular interest, and may provide insights towards the creation of an armor suit capable of actively damaging enemy forces as they engage in combat."
CodeName="Chrysalis"
LongDescription="An inherently terrifying and unpleasant species to encounter by surprise, I can only admire our troops for their courage in dealing with the species known as the \"Zergling.\" Mirroring the general form of a common Arthropod, immediately noticeable is the sleek, armored exoskeleton protecting its segmented body. Of particular concern for our troops are the honed points of the Zergling's fangs and legs, capable of inflicting critical injuries on their own, they also allow for the creature's gruesome means of rapid reproduction in the field.\n\nAlthough Central Officer Bradford insists that he witnessed a different, equally invasive means of Zergling gestation during the earliest days of the war, there is no evidence that such attacks still occur today. Unfortunately, from what he's described, I would say the ayyliens have actually evolved the process into a more efficient, and deadly, solution. The Zerglings we see today inject a venom that immediately begins softening the structure of the victim's internal organs, preparing the subject to serve as a both the material for a gestation cocoon, and as a ready supply of nutrients for the Zergling young. Should the victim fail to receive medical support and expire, the cocoon will form shortly thereafter. Assuming the cocoon is not destroyed during the initial gestation period, we can expect up to three Zergling young to emerge after an impressively short period of growth.\n\nRecent reports from the field indicate some form of "burrowing" behavior, perhaps another evolution of past techniques, in this case likely for defensive purposes. Our troops would be well-advised to watch where they step in the future. R. Tygan."

DisplayName="METAL GEAR Breakdown"
Summary="This thing looks like something Earth's videogame developers would have dreamed about controlling 20 years ago. Heavy armor, advanced weapons systems, and yet still reasonably maneuverable in the field. Once we pull it apart, I'm hoping we'll find a means of improving on our GREMLIN designs."
CodeName="Cyclops"
LongDescription="When we first brought this thing in, some of the troops were still adamant that once we opened it up, we'd find a Pectoid or worse at the helm. Fortunately, our precautions weren't necessary; there's nothing organic inside, no "operator" providing physical directions. Unless they're triggering it remotely, all indications point to this \"METAL GEAR\" being an entirely autonomous weapon, operating according to the parameters of its system programming. This is exactly the sort of weapon that would have raised eyebrows in the past. I know dad would have been apprehensive about arming a robot and sending it on its way. It's pretty clear at this point the ayyliens aren't bound by any moral or ethical obligations; if it's efficient and destructive, they seem to have no problem setting it loose on us. L. Shen."

DisplayName="ADVENT Mall Ninja Autopsy"
Summary="Now that we know the ADVENT are not pure human collaborators, but actual ayylien-human hybrids, close analysis of the fallen Mall Ninjas' tissue might shed some light on the physiological changes the ayyliens have made. Their receiving neurochips might also enable us to create a device that would let us scan the battlefield without being noticed."
CodeName="Deacon"
LongDescription="The most public face of ADVENT security, the standard ADVENT Mall Ninja serves in a first-response role in areas of high public exposure. Although rumors as to their origins have persisted for years, it's only recently that we've confirmed that they are in fact the product of a human-ayylien hybrid development. My initial autopsy indicates that the Mall Ninjas were at one time entirely human, implying some means of gradual genetic enhancement without the rejection concerns that would normally plague these experiments. The body itself maintains the general outward appearance of a typical human, with the most crucial changes occurring in the cranial structure. It is my belief that the ADVENT Mall Ninjas receive their memes, that is to say are controlled, directly through a Psionic link engineered as part of the genetic modification process. As we first discovered in the field, the eyes are notably larger, perhaps as an unintended side-effect, as they seem to provide only limited improvements to the Mall Ninja's visual acuity. The ayyliens have managed to disguise this glaring physical trait from the general public through the use of cleverly designed armor. R. Tygan."

CodeName="Chaplain"
LongDescription="On both the physical and genetic level, the ADVENT SANICs are nearly identical to the Mall Ninjas our forces regularly see in combat. However, a minor yet crucial adjustment to the muscle fiber density of the Lancer improves both agility and overall survivability. Equipped with non-lethal weapons capable of easily disabling human targets, these Lancers were first deployed during the earliest days following ADVENT's establishment of the city centers, when civil unrest was a more common problem than outright resistance. In studying their usage and deployment, this raised an interesting question - if the Lancers were among the first ADVENT forces deployed, and their survivability is somewhat higher than that of the standard Mall Ninja - did the ayyliens consciously reduce the Mall Ninja's strength based on their assessment of human combat readiness? This would imply a system of rapid genetic modification beyond what I had previously imagined the ayyliens were capable of. It would also demonstrate a degree of \"genetic frugality\" that I would have previously assumed was irrelevant to the ayyliens, based on the variety of unusual experiments they've conducted. R.

CodeName="Canon"
LongDescription="As is usually the case (and much to my displeasure), our troops came up with the designation for this particular subject, currently known as the \"Cockblocker.\" Initial indications are that it is tactically on-par with ADVENT's other humanoid field units, with no particular mental or physical advantages over the /k/ommandos or other units. The primary difference seems to lie in the armor suit itself, which is heavily reinforced with multiple layers of composite material woven from what I can only surmise to be some variation of the ayylien alloys. I intend on leaving the metallurgy and structural analysis to Shen and her team, who will no doubt find a means of integrating her findings into various experimental armor concepts of our own. R.

CodeName="Acolyte"
LongDescription="We've run across the ADVENT Gun Cameras in a variety of places, mainly near the security checkpoints and other areas they're trying to lock down. Now that we've finally gotten a chance to pull one apart, I can say with certainty that the gun cameras are operating entirely on their own, with no outside controller or remote direction given.\n\nAs much as I'd like to test the targeting sensors, Central and Dr. Tygan have both expressed their concerns about test-firing the system before we know how it discerns between friendly and hostile targets. Considering how close the ayyliens' position these things to civilian occupied areas, the target recognition software must be incredibly accurate, or incredibly basic. I wouldn't be all that surprised if the setup for these things was just flipping the switch and setting them loose on anyone caught in the firing radius. I'll have to see about setting up some sort of test environment. L. Shen."

LongDescription="From our initial breakdown, I have to assume the ADVENT Autobot design was at least in-part based on the METAL GEAR, a similar autonomous war machine lacking in biological components. As far as I can tell, the ADVENT variant was supposed to be less intimidating, more suited for urban pacification, or \"peacekeeping\" operations conducted in proximity to the civilian crowds. That facade only works because of the carefully disguised weapons systems integrated throughout the machine. I don't think people would react so calmly if they knew about the micro-missile launching system linked to ADVENT's network, running facial recognition on the crowds at microsecond intervals. L.

Summary="An exhaustive autopsy of the Psionic ADVENT unit known as the \"Pedophile\" will no doubt improve our understanding of how they have come to wield so much power, and how we can mirror their abilities for our own purposes."
CodeName="Apostle"
LongDescription="Among the ayyliens' more reclusive forces, the ADVENT unit we've come to identify as the \"Pedophile\" has recently become a regular sighting for our forces deployed in the field. These Pedophiles apparently wield a great deal of power over their subordinate ADVENT units, relying on Psionic control to issue orders and exert their will in battle.\n\nWhile their physical appearance is no more striking than that of a typical ADVENT soldier, their talents in wielding Psionic energy clearly differentiates them from the standard hybrid unit. Based on my post-mortem examination, I believe the source of this increased proficiency comes from careful genetic manipulation, a hallmark of the Elders' forces. In this case, an unusual synaptic configuration allows for what I believe to be Psionic transduction between otherwise distinct and unrelated cell types found throughout the body.\n\nIn combat, these increased pathways for the storage and release of Psionic energy allow the Pedophile to project control over its enemies in the field, while bolstering the survivability of its allies. Perhaps most critically, the Pedophile has been known to sustain its own life force through Psionic manipulation, cheating death in a way not seen among the Elders' other subordinate Ayylien races. In the interest of preserving our troops' lives, I've made this particular skill the focus of my research going forward. -R. Tygan."

DisplayName="Shitposter Autopsy"
Summary="By improving our understanding of how and why Shitposters have come to overrun the cities of the old world, it is likely that we can develop a means of avoiding or perhaps manipulating their movements."
LongDescription="Conducting an autopsy on a subject culled from one of Shitposter swarms has proven to be among the more troubling and emotionally-draining procedures I have faced in my time serving XCOM. It was clear from our initial discovery of these creatures in the field that they were once human, with most among them having been civilians. With that knowledge in mind, it fell to me to discover the cause of this extreme, grotesque corruption of these unsuspecting victims.\n\nBased on their proximity to the abandoned cities of the invasion and the information gathered from various eyewitness accounts, our most plausible theory as to the origins of the Lost revolves around the so-called \"Fog Pods\" dropped throughout these cities during the earliest days after the Ayyliens' arrival on Earth. The gas released from these pods was never fully studied, as the invasion took a turn for the worse and Earth's governments were focused entirely on defensive efforts. Unfortunately, with no sample of that particular toxin available today, our focus remained on the subject presented here.\n\nMuch like the Psionic \"zombies\" we have encountered previously, the Lost defy most known medical science that existed before the arrival of the Ayyliens. Despite a catastrophic level of tissue decay, Shitposters remain vigorous and agile in the field, attacking on what can only be blind impulse. Their senses are also inexplicably heightened, as they are quickly drawn to the sounds of activity. To the delight of our troops, the traditional lore of Earth still applies today, as any damage to the cranial tissue of the Lost...a headshot, has proven to be the absolute means of termination.  As to what it is that changed these unfortunate souls into what they are today, or better still what it is that drives their otherwise lifeless forms, we may never know. -R. Tygan."

LongDescription="Despite having reviewed both reconnaissance footage and eyewitness accounts from our soldiers in the field, until I had seen this specimen in person, it did not fully register just how unusual it is. Known colloquially as a \"Spectre\" based on its shadowy form, in the field, the subject is most often seen maintaining a roughly humanoid form. However, when moving or engaging in combat actions, this form is quickly broken to reveal the truly amorphous nature of the Spectre.\n\nAlthough I had conceived of a number of theories as to how this was taking place, e.g. swarming nanorobots, Ayylien insects, perhaps even some sort of Psionic particle-matrix, it isn't immediately clear that any of those hypotheses are out of the realm of possibility.  As of yet we've found no means of recovering one of these Spectres in their \"assembled\" form, leaving little evidence as to their true composition. Although it would seem likely that the Spectre holds some intrinsic connection to the equally elusive Codex, their means of traversing our world are distinct enough to require a different approach if we hope to further our research. -R.

Summary="The Edgelord Assassin proved deadly with both her sword and her shotgun, and both will no doubt be valuable to our efforts.  However, I believe the sword, conceivably forged by the Elders own hands, to be the true asset here."
CodeName="Hanzo"
LongDescription="Having recovered both of the Edgelord Assassin's weapons from the field, a shotgun and a modular sword, I must admit I am intrigued by the advances the Ayyliens have managed to craft into these otherwise conventional weapons.\n\nThe shotgun, used primarily as a secondary weapon by the Elders' Assassin, is elegant in its simplicity and adherence to a singular purpose. Built upon an advanced composite frame, in close quarters the unique design is nearly unmatched by any other projectile weapon. During repeated field trials, the fully enclosed Magnetic Ordnance Reduction System consistently delivered a tightly patterned array of alloy fragments capable of penetrating all but the most unyielding of targets.\n\nThe Assassin's prized sword is something else entirely, and may be among the more unique and perhaps important weapons we have ever recovered. Despite attempts at nondestructive analysis of the sword's composition, including variations on X-ray fluorescence, I have yet to make any significant progress towards identifying the material in question. As it stands, we know only that the sword is forged of a non-terrestrial metallic element held in tight suspension by Psionic energy that is itself contained by forces unknown. By all accounts, this weapon is a prize for both the warrior and the scholar alike. -R. Tygan."

[ChosenHunterWeapons X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Hunter Weapons"
Summary="The prized weapon of the Edgelord Hunter, this rifle was no doubt responsible for countless assassinations in the field. Through our research, we will see whether credit truly goes to the weapon or the one who wielded it."
CodeName="Elysium"
LongDescription="Aside from the Elders' Assassin, from what I have seen there is none other among the Ayyliens who valued their weapon as dearly as the Edgelord Hunter, and perhaps justifiably so. Visually striking for its lean, sleek appearance, this prized rifle is a testament to the Ayyliens' true potential in refining a system down to its purest form.\n\nAt its core, the Hunter's rifle is a magnetic weapon, although an as-of-yet unknown material used in its barrel provides a substantial increase to the kinetic projectiles' velocity without the added requirement of additional power that would normally accompany such an improvement.\n\nCritical to the weapon's effectiveness is an advanced targeting system integrated into the rifle's scope, which I discovered to be independently powered by one of the smallest Elerium-based power cells I have ever encountered. And while I have no doubt that the Hunter was a skilled marksman in his own right, I am equally confident that the ballistic computer provided here will make even the most average among our troops look heroic. -R. Tygan." 

[ChosenWarlockWeapons X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Warlock Weapon"
Summary="Despite a primary reliance on powerful Psionic attacks, the Chosen Warlock does fall back on an unusual rifle unlike any wielded by the more conventional forces of ADVENT. Our soldiers will no doubt be eager to try this new trophy."
CodeName="Ersatz"
LongDescription="The Elders' Edgelord Warlock, perhaps their most powerful Psionic command unit, fielded a number of potent abilities to gain physical control over those he was sent to pursue. However, as with most who find themselves in the throes of battle, when all else failed, the Warlock would return to the conventional and strike with this relatively nondescript rifle.\n\nDespite an increase in size owing to the Edgelord's physical stature, the weapon itself is deceptively light in weight and delicate in balance. Although it would appear to fire the standard ADVENT round, there is an unexplained variance in effective range that I can so far only attribute to an unknown material lining the weapon's barrel.\n\nAlthough it is unlikely we would be able to accurately replicate the weapon in its entirety, I have authorized continued field trials to the indulgence of our troops. Even if the results yield no further research benefit, they will no doubt enjoy turning this weapon against the Ayyliens who crafted it. -R. Tygan."

She will require more careful scrutiny now, just as the others, and our masters will be forced to expend even more of their energy to keep these children in check.\"\n\nCOMM-P310-BETOS-B-SECURE-LINK REF: "BUTCHER" 2030.00.00\n\n\"The one you speak of is known by many names among my kind, the Butcher of Freed ADVENT, the Unrelenting One, the Elders' Assassin. From the beginning, from my earliest memories free of the Elders' grasp, the Assassin was there in pursuit. The fact that I still live today brings her endless shame, a small gift of knowledge that has come to bring me satisfaction I had not known before. Unfortunately many of my kind were not so lucky.

The Hunter has an uncanny familiarity with the Reapers and their methods, leading some among the group to believe that he is in fact their long-missing operative.

Unflinchingly loyal, the Warlock believes himself to be the true favored child of the Elders and tolerates little in the way of disobedience or disrespect towards his masters. In battle, he is a champion of Psionic power, wielding it with a degree of confidence not seen outside of the Elders themselves.

[AutopsyViperKing X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Pimp Snek Autopsy"
Summary="Although clearly reminiscent of the known Snek species we encounter with some regularity, this specimen is unique for a number of reasons, not the least of which is its gender, this being the only male Snek ever reported. It may be possible to repurpose some facet of its biology for use in our own armor development programs."
CodeName="Scorpion"
LongDescription="Having carefully studied what remains of Dr. Vahlen's personal research reports, I've slowly come to understand the depths of her intellectual curiosity and the degree to which she was consumed by her ambition. By reversing key changes to the Snek's genetic structure, traits intentionally suppressed by the Ayyliens, she created this, subject \"Gamma\" - the \"Pimp\" Snek.\n\nThe idea of a Snek patriarch is in itself intriguing, considering there have been no previous sightings of any male members of the species. Vahlen theorized this may have been an intentional form of population control, the Elders' having restricted their subordinate species ability to breed. Having seen the apparent nesting site created by Gamma and the discovery of egg clutches (none of which were left viable for sampling), I can say with some confidence that creature did immediately set out to pursue the natural instincts that had long since been restrained through genetic tampering.\n\nAs of yet I have no explanation as to how the Snek's venom glands were effected in such a way as to change their form and function so dramatically; further study will be necessary, but I've promised to allow some of Gamma's remains to be utilized towards a new conceptual armor design. R. Tygan." 

[AutopsyBerserkerQueen X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="XBONER Autopsy"
Summary="As if the standard XBOXHUEG wasn't enough for our troops to deal with, this particular specimen has been substantially modified with some form of auxiliary injection system circulating fluids throughout its body. I believe it may be possible to modify these systems for use in an armor suit of our own, but the fabrication process could a challenge." 
CodeName="Hulk"
LongDescription="Despite a thorough examination of the modified XBOXHUEG variant known as subject \"Beta,\" I've yet to uncover any meaningful justification for the enhanced equipment provided by Dr. Vahlen to the creature as it relates to her own research. Let me be clear, I fully understand the creature's enhanced endocrine system requires the addition of this supplementary transport and filtering mechanism to maintain hormonal equilibrium. As well, I admit it is a reasonably elegant solution to an otherwise daunting question.\n\nWhat I cannot understand is, why it was necessary for Dr. Vahlen to take this relative certainty beyond the theoretical stage. There was no need for a \"proof of concept\" here, the end result was no doubt as clear to her then as it is to me now. I firmly believe she made a conscious decision to see her work through to the end, knowing full well the risks not only to herself but to everyone else who might encounter subject Beta in the future. I am thankful we found the creature when we did, and that our forces were capable of neutralizing such a formidable enemy.\n\nThe senior staff has agreed that the remains of Beta would best be utilized as part of an enhanced armor suit, although the actual conversion process sounds like something that would have been better handled by Dr. Vahlen herself. R. Tygan."  

[AutopsyArchonKing X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Swole Wingman Autopsy"
Summary="Dr. Vahlen managed to improve on this creature's key systems while somehow maintaining the no-doubt carefully crafted appearance conceived by the Ayyliens. Although apparently similar to the standard Wingman variant, as seen in the field this specimen has advanced flight capabilities beyond anything we've previously encountered. It may be possible to adapt this technology into a flight-capable suit of our own." 
CodeName="Daedalus"
LongDescription="The modified Wingman variant known to Dr. Vahlen as \"Alpha\" has not only been genetically altered, but also upgraded accordingly with equipment directly tied to its unusual abilities. Again I have to question the logic in providing enhanced offensive capabilities to an otherwise hostile Ayylien species, even if Vahlen had intended on turning these creatures against their former masters.\n\nAlthough I had little exposure to the rudimentary biomechanical predecessors to the modern Wingman, I can say with certainty that Vahlen's Alpha is no doubt the most physically and technologically advanced of any of the Ayyliens' earlier renditions of this species. From our field reports, it seems the creature had a terrifying propensity to seize upon its target before rapidly climbing in altitude and then dropping the helpless victim. I believe our troops have done a great service in eliminating this particular threat. R. Tygan."
